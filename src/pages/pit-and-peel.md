🥑🍌 Richmond District Store Manager
●	Managed food and labor cost, scheduling, private events and employees for two stores. I helped re-engineer restaurant operations and establish standards for franchising to reduced ticket times by 80%. Helped develop new menu for three stores in order to standardize supply chain and operations. I contracted a designer for a new website designed to fit modern-day business marketing strategies
