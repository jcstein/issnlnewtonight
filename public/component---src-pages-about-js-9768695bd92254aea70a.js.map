After graduating from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, I decided to continue my education at Virginia Commonwealth University to study mechanical engineering. After taking a detour from school to cook and manage kitchens, I am set to graduate in May with a Bachelor's of Science from VCU's School of Business with a concentration in Supply Chain Management and Analytics and a minor in Mathematics.</p>\n      <p>I am a motivated self-starter who is passionate about reducing food waste and ensuring every person can eat the meals they need to survive. Currently, I am volunteering to help restore food security in the greater Boston, Massachusetts region with Project Restore Us. I am a third-generation Holocaust survivor and I have found my heritage more relevant as racial and economic disparities are magnified in our society each day. I have been photographing the DC region since my high-school days, but most recently fell in love with photography again in 2019 after documenting Kendall Street Company shows on the East Coast and co-founding Lattice Supply in Richmond.</p>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`"],"sourceRoot":""}
